  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - lib/assets/images/cup.png
    - lib/assets/images/wade_default.png
    - lib/assets/images/wade_wave.png
    - lib/assets/images/wade_running.png

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see

  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
